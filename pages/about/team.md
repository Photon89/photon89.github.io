## The Team

{% include image path="https://shutter-project.org/wp-content/uploads/me.jpg" id="mario-pic" %} **Mario Kemper**, developer and project founder

I work as a consultant with focus on software quality assurance. You might want to have a look at my [interview](http://blog.launchpad.net/projects/shutter) at http://blog.launchpad.net to read more about the reasons and goals of the project.

I am addicted to free software and community driven projects. In addition to modest abilities in C/C++, PHP, Java and some experiences with .NET languages I am mostly interested in Perl (Shutter is written in Perl as well) nowadays.

**Vadim Peretokin**, promotion, web presence and interface design

I’m an IT healthcare student in YorkU, Toronto. I’m interested in promoting quality open-source software and my work in Shutter includes expanding it’s popularity and interface design. Programming languages of interest are C and Vala.
