### Screencasts

#### Selection Tool

Shutter provides a tool to capture a rectangular region of your screen. The selection can be resized and moved. Also, there is a dialog that allows you to enter the width, height, X and Y position of the selection manually. The screen can be zoomed (with Ctrl+Mouse wheel), a small zoom window sitting in the screen corner shows the surroundings of the mouse cursor.

### Window Selection

Youâ€™ll see a nice animated effect when hovering over the windows on your desktop with your mouse displaying the window title and geometry of the currently selected window.

### Capture menus and tooltips

When capturing a menu or a tooltip, there is a sufficiently long delay to make the menu or tooltip visible on the screen.
